          <h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p>Collaborating with students to provide opportunities and engagement through e-learning experiences. Student absences can often provide insight to the lives of the students through implicit conversations. Through action research (McNiff, 2017, Taylor, 2007, 2010), cooperative inquiry (Heron, 1996), and servant leadership, the collaborative efforts of myself and a group of secondary school student participants discussed their views on the barriers of the Covid-19 lockdown, e-learning, and what success meant to them. Student voice is essential in finding out how co-creating e-learning experiences with students affect their ability to engage in learning when frequently absent? Co-creating e-learning experiences with students provids opportunities for success. The opportunities for success through collaboration through student voice and e-learning provide value for students where time is of the essence and an extra hand is lent. Their ability to engage in the learning is evident through the determination of people assisting students to feel success through time and effort.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This research project involves working with students to develop and co-create e-learning experiences that provide opportunities for absent students to learn and engage remotely. There are many avenues and platforms that can create e-learning experiences however I believe that for students to benefit from e-learning they need to bring their own voice to the conversation.</p>

        Emerging out of my desire to provide more equitable learning opportunities for students, there were students who were consistently absent from school and missed out on the learning opportunities being taught during school time. These absences were often out of their control due to family commitments such as families requiring their children to work part time, or needing them to take care of their sick and elderly, etc. This greatly affected their learning and my ability to teach the students well. Implementing another avenue of content delivery to students with the help student voices could still provide equitable opportunities for all students regardless of attendance. 
          
        <p>I aim to create innovative solutions on how learning online can be done through iterative processes. I will be collaborating with students as co-researchers to identify problems and working on solutions together. I will be leading this project using Action Research and Cooperative Inquiry (Heron, 1996) as I firmly believe that all students should have the right to learn in a manner that benefits them. Collaborating with students and using cooperative inquiry ensures the learning will benefit them because students know themselves best and what works for them This is one way I can work towards more equitable learning for my absent students because I will not be making assumptions about what is best for them, instead I will be listening and learning from them. </p>

        <p>The terms co-researcher/s and participant/s will be used interchangeably throughout this proposal. It refers to the student/s who volunteer to collaborate and cooperate on the project. I will be leading this collaborative project as a researcher with my co-researchers. As the project is also about improving my teacher practice, I will refer to myself as the lead researcher. Co-researchers have the opportunity to lead a potentially new method of learning within the Computer Studies classes and potentially schoolwide through e-learning experiences.</p>
        
        <p>There are various types of methods where students learn best such as one on one with a teacher, in a group setting, repetitive writing, etc. To find which method suits my students more, I need to ask what works best for them and how can I apply it through e-learning. </p>
          
        <p>The approach provides social justice and equity as the direction of the project is determined by my co-researchers (Taylor, 2007, 2010). The traditional methods of teaching generally try to find a one size fits all, but the aim of the project is for an all size fits all. The students will be able to contribute as a whole to how they prefer to learn. In my experience as a learner, I have never been involved as a co-researcher and suspect it will be the same for my students. My co-researchers will be able to have agency over their own learning and will also have the ability to use their voice for change.</p>

        <h2>Project Context</h2>
          <p>
            Auckland Seventh-Day Adventist High School is a secondary school located in Mangere, Auckland, New Zealand with a student population of approximately 290 students as of 2020. The ethnic population can be displayed as Tongan (42%), Samoan (17%), Cook Island (11%), Maori (8%), NZ European (6%), with other countries represented such as Niuean, Fijian, Filipino, Tuvaluan, Indian, South African, Kiribatian, Tokelauan, Vietnamese, and European. The diversity of the students reflects the diverse population of Auckland especially of South Auckland. Auckland Seventh-Day Adventist High School (ASDAH) also has diverse staff consisting of Pasifika, African, European, and Asian ethnicities. ASDAH provides special character education along with the New Zealand Curriculum for students from Year 7 to Year 13 (13 to 19-year olds).
          </p>

          <p>
            Auckland Seventh-Day Adventist High School is one of many secondary schools with students who are consistently absent from school and miss out on the learning opportunities provided. Absences through no fault of the students but through family commitments such as working to assist with income or taking care of their sick and elderly family members. My initial aim of the project was to work in collaboration with a core group of students who were targeted as frequently absent. This core group would provide suggestions on learning with the current challenges of being unable to attend school during school hours. Suggestions brought by students are co-created through e-learning experiences. Student voices are valuable when they are brought to the conversation of education.
          </p>

          <p>
            The research project occurred during Term 3 with interruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic which limited the project to be as effective as possible. The pandemic prompted a national state of emergency to place the first lockdown on the entire country for around 6 weeks before allowing schools to reopen. A second lockdown was placed on Auckland after community transmission occurred promoting schools to be shut down once again and for learning to continue online. The second lockdown has caused changes to the initial proposed timeline for the project however much of the data collected and analysed provides critical discussion on the issues of social justice and inequity.
          </p>

      <div class="div-project-aim" id="project-aim">
        <h2>Project Aim</h2>
          <p>The aim of the project was to examine the impact of co-creating e-learning experiences with students, on their ability to engage in learning when frequently absent which was aimed as the following question:</p>

          <b>How does co-creating e-learning experiences with students affect their ability to engage in learning when frequently absent?</b>
            
          <p>The project began to seek an answer or discussion for this question and in searching for an answer, an opportunity for some minor questions could be directly or indirectly answered which could expand on responding to the main question. The minor questions are:</p>
            
          <i>What are the students’ views on learning at school and at home?<br>
          What does engaged learning look like for students?<br>
          How do students learn or what method of learning works best?<br>
          What are students’ ideas for addressing learning while absent from school?<br>
          What are students’ reflections on the initiatives we try?</i>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div-methodologies" id="methodologies">
        <h2>Methodologies</h2>
          <p>
            Action research (McNiff, 2017, Taylor, 2007, 2010) and cooperative inquiry (Heron, 1996) were used together to ensure equitable opportunities for students through feedback and collaboration. Both methodologies are founded on the principles of social justice and equity (Mirra, 2016). Using action research and cooperative inquiry to guide this research project, the contribution and input from students provided them with power to make possible changes of how teaching and learning can be innovated.</p>

            <p>Action research is a cyclic and iterative process involving both action and reflection (McNiff 2017, Taylor, 2007, 2010) and allows the students to make changes for themselves in their social situations (McNiff, 2017).  Cooperative inquiry requires a group to collaborate over a shared and common goal which is connected to action research. Both methodologies gave students agency in their learning but also in their potential to create change in the way classes are taught. </p>
            
            <p>Servant leadership drove this project largely as a desire to provide more equitable learning opportunities for students. To serve the needs of the students first became a priority in ensuring they were being heard and given the power to create change. The traditional form of teaching is deconstructed to a shared power between teacher and student. The student is served by the teacher which provides opportunities for a fluid and shared pool of knowledge between student and teacher.</p>
            
            <p>There are three phrases that guide the project which link with action research, cooperative inquiry, and servant leadership. The three phrases are:</p>
            <h3>Phase 1: Asking and Dreaming</h3>
            <p>The initial phase is the formation of the group of participants that came together. The group of students worked in collaboration with me to discuss the minor questions. These questions provide the groundwork from where to begin. The collaborative discussions were to provide the students with agency and with a voice. Phase 1 required the students to see me as an equal as to enable a shared power dynamic. Students become accustomed to listening with the teacher having more “power”, there would be a lack of authentic co-construction if students were unable to voice their genuine opinions or thoughts. Servant leadership looks at serving others so that’s what I did.
            The information gathered from the Asking and Dreaming phase can be used to implement e-learning experiences to provide opportunities for students to succeed and engage students to learn differently from the traditional form of teaching. Implementations occur during the Phase 2: Acting.</p>
            <h3>Phase 2: Acting</h3>
            <p>The information from Asking and Dreaming is implemented for students as voiced by students. The e-learning experiences were created by myself through the ideas of the students. This provides students with a sense of change being made through their voice. The empowerment through which their opinions or thoughts allows for equitable learning. Listening to the opinions and suggestions of those frequently absent is essential to providing them with what they need to feel success. </p>
            <h3>Phase 3: Reflecting Together</h3>
            <p>Phase 3: Reflecting Together was supposed to wrap up all the findings and discuss with the students how the project went. The reflections would provide useful for finding themes and patterns that could help answer the project aim and minor questions but more importantly, it could help ignite a change that could benefit the learning of the students.</p>
            <p>The initial timeline was for the Asking and Dreaming phase to take 2 weeks, the Acting phase to take 4 weeks, and the Reflecting Together to take 2 weeks. The length of time for each phase was shortened to these set time frames due to the first lockdown however the second lockdown had to shorten the time frames from a couple of weeks to 1 week. The shortened length of time for the phases meant that complications were more frequent as the project time frame was condensed.</p>

      <div class="div-data-collection" id="data-collection">
        <h2>Data collection</h2>
        
        <p>Student voice provides teachers and educators the opportunity to implement changes in the traditional form of education. The traditional form of education is generally teacher centric as students try to consume the information and content given. Conversations with students throughout the project has provided valuable information about the lives of students with the opportunity to have an in-depth analysis. </p>
          
        <p>The data collected consists of audio and video recordings. The following are transcripts including their audio and video recordings. The data represents dialogue between myself and the group. The collaborative discussions provide the students to engage with the possibility of future change within the subject. The data was collected after the second lockdown during Term 3. Initials are used to show which person is speaking.</p>

        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The qualitative data collected provides a small insight on how students are feeling and what students are going through whether it was stated explicitly or implicitly. There are themes in the data which can be overlooked however by examining the impact of the struggles of hardship and the thoughts of the students, it provides a more thorough view of what students go through.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Barriers during lockdown</h3>
        <p>Students faced challenges during the second lockdown, most likely more so than the first lockdown. More students were absent for online classes compared to the first lockdown especially with students being provided with digital devices from the Ministry of Education. Some of the challenges were to do with the student's personal life. Some students needed to find a job to help their parents and support their family. Conversations from Figures 9 & 10 show that a student was working during school hours but chose education which sadly resulted in them losing their job. The social justice issue of a student having to choose between them investing in their future or choosing to provide for their families.</p>
        
        <h3>Student view on success</h3>
        <p>Success can have multiple meanings to multiple people. There is no one view of success that everyone strives towards to feel a sense of accomplishment. One of the responses from Figures 7 & 8 when asked, “What does it mean to be successful?”, was “working as a team”. The response was expanded to “....like if you set a goal, one person sets a goal and we all work as a team and…”. This response provides an insight of collaboration as a 21st century thinker. Maurie Abraham, principal of Hobsonville Point Secondary School at the time of this report spoke of the problem of the <i>paradigm of one.</i></p>

        <blockquote>One class, one hour, one subject, one teacher, one set of activities, one pace, one way of teaching, one assessment, one way of leading (Abraham, 2014)</blockquote>
        
        <p>The paradigm of one disconnects learners from subject to subject or from teacher to teacher when learning is how “stuff is connected to other stuff” (Abraham, 2020). The traditional form of teaching follows the paradigm of one closely. The student notes success as collaborative with a common goal. The paradigm of many connects the many different parts of schooling that can produce critical 21st century thinkers.</p>
        
        <blockquote>“Many ways of learning, many contexts for learning, many ways of teaching, many ways to show evidence of learning, many excellences, many ways of excelling and being bright, many leaders” (Abraham, 2014)</blockquote>

        <p>Comments made by students stated that for them, money makes you successful. As seen in Figures 7 & 8, there is a response that money can “buy stuff you want to” and “provides a lot of opportunities.” Looking closely at these 2 responses of how money creates success, the question then becomes, “if money makes you feel successful, does having no money mean you are not successful?” The notion that students see money as success is quite dangerous and scary. Money, according to the saying, makes the world go round but what if you  are trapped in the cycle of poverty. The circumstances which students may have no control over could be placed in situations of hardship and tribulation. Some families are trapped in poverty where the means of escaping poverty require capital, education, or networking. If the income you are earning is barely enough to put food on the table or to place a shelter over your head, then the lack of resources remaining forces you back to where you started. The cycle generally continues unless there is outside intervention. Students who are working to provide for their families are taking the time away from education to put food on the table. The dilemma becomes once the student is old enough to leave high school, they may have effectively impaired their chances of gaining the skills and knowledge to pursue a higher education or a higher paying job.</p>

        <p>Lastly, the view of success for one student was when success is “things go as planned.” In Figures 5 & 6 for this student, things diverging from the plan would be considered the opposite of success, failure. Similar to the explanation above, the idea that a plan deviating from its objective is considered a failure could also be seen as dangerous. Dangerous in the sense that students may see mistakes as failures instead of an opportunity to learn because to the students, mistakes could be interpreted as making the goal more difficult to achieve. Circumstances beyond control are going to affect plans making them harder to reach such as a student wanting to go to school and learn however they are unable to because they need to look after their unwell parents. Should the student who has ambition and drive to go to school but unable to due to unforeseen circumstances be seen as a failure? The mindset of a student hoping for things to go as planned for it to be made complicated creates a sense of hopelessness for the student.

        <h2>The Story of Sione</h2>
        <p>The Story of Sione is one story of many. The Story of Sione does not represent all Pasifika students, but it represents the struggles and challenges that some students face during their high school years. This story is not to be used as a blanket statement for all Pasifika students but many students may relate to some parts of the story. Sione is a pseudonym for the real student’s name but to ensure anonymity and privacy of them and their vulnerabilities, the name Sione is used.</p>

        <p>Sione is a humble, caring, and capable student in my Year 13 Digital Technology class. Their attitude and character livens the room and brings joy into the classroom. Sione has the potential and capabilities like many other students to succeed however their low attendance has affected their ability to learn the content required to succeed academically in the classroom.</p>
        
        <p>Sione is faced with challenges that they have no control over. Sione has worked during the lockdown and has unfortunately worked during school too. The circumstances where Sione has to choose receiving an education or working part time is conflicted with Sione’s unwell father. The decision a student has to make between building a better future pathway for himself through high school or helping to keep the income coming should not have to be placed on someone so young.</p>
          
        <p>Situations such as Sione’s are echoed in the poem of Aigagalefili ‘Fili’ Fepulea’i-Tapua’i, Head Girl of Aorere College in 2020, <blockquote>“if knowledge is power, why does it come at a price we can’t afford?” (Fepulea’i-Tapua’i, 2020).</blockquote> Fili’s poem struck the New Zealand headlines as she was upset with the negative portrayal of her community in the media. The poem spoke for the many students and families who were hit hardest during the lockdown with students who swapped <blockquote>“leavers notices for CV’s cuz money is low & mouths gotta eat.” (Fepulea’i-Tapua’i, 2020).</blockquote> The struggle to make ends meet moves the compass from education to survival. The focus of a student should be towards enjoying their youth with their peers, studying for their exams, getting involved with extracurricular activities instead of working with or for their families during the evening until early morning when the general public is ready to begin their day.</p>

        <p>During an after-school tutorial session, Sione asked me about my diet as I eat a plant-based diet as mentioned in Figures 13 & 14, “Sir, how hard is it to be a vegetarian?”. My initial reaction was a chuckle, because it is unusual for a Pasifika male, such as myself, to refrain from eating meat so I thought Sione was filling the dead silence with light conversation. The lightened mood was met with a more serious atmosphere when Sione explained the reason for wanting to know if it was difficult is because their father was unwell. The diet of vegetables, fruits, beans, and other natural foods, Sione thought, was a way of becoming strong for their father. Sione has another predicament on top of providing income for their family but taking care of their ill father.</p>

        <p>I asked Sione along with the other students of the research group what success is. Sione was the first to respond with “things that go as planned”. As mentioned in the data collection, there is a dangerous mindset when it comes to seeing success as “things going as planned” but now reflecting on Sione’s responses, Sione is facing challenge after challenge as he struggles to attend school regularly. Sione has no control over the unexpected complications which are brought into light through no fault of their own. The hardship and barriers that prevent Sione from succeeding, in the western sense, is disheartening. Things going as planned in the traditional sense of a student would be to live the life of a teenager. Sione sadly must put the life of a teenager on hold to make way for responsibilities beyond that of a teenager.</p>

        <p>The suggestions brought by the students to provide after-school sessions was insightful. Implementing the after school session provided students with agency as students could volunteer to join the session. The sessions were to be used to assist students who were unable to make school during the day or if students required assistance with assessments. Sione used these sessions the most effectively with Sione generally being the only one to show up. The session would allow me to assist in providing instruction on how to install software, coding, debugging etc. Sione used the time, little time that Sione had, to continue aiming to succeed in the class. Sione took the initiative through self-directed learning to work on what he could. Sione’s decision to work hard displays determination to not only succeed academically, but to implicitly break out of the trap of poverty.</p>

        <p>Sione’s story weaves the data collected from the research project and it displays the interconnecting issues of the different struggles some students face on a daily basis.</p>

      <div class="div-limitations" id="limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>The timeline of the project was condensed from a couple of months to weeks due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The research project provided some valuable information but due to the constraints of time, there was a need for acceleration in the research which may or may not have impacted the data collection and data analysis.</p>
        <p>The group of voluntary students provided valuable information and data which helped build the narrative of the Story of Sione. There are connections to the narratives of all the students however Sione was connected to all aspects of the data collection and analysis, the Story of Sione can be seen as data collected from only one student which is not the case.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="div-discussion" id="discussion">
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The project aimed to answer the question, how does co-creating e-learning experiences with students affect their ability to engage in learning when frequently absent? The project provided an insight into the social justice and inequities of the lives of the students without the need to be told explicitly.</p>

        <p>Working in collaboration with the students through the methodologies of action research and cooperative inquiry, the findings provided valuable. The findings assisted in servant leadership as the comments made by students displayed a shift of power from the teacher to a balance of both student and teacher. To serve the needs of the students was visible through the collaboration of ideas from students to those ideas being implemented. Students were provided with the ability to create change within the class through student voice and self-directed learning. The traditional form of teaching was broken down from teacher-centred to student-led.</p>
          
        <p>Success was seen differently for each student but each student saw success through a western lens. The idea that success is money and things going as planned tend to be large goals that should not have to be seen as success. Success should be enjoying life with friends, playing sports, spending time with family where there is no measurement. The idea of success having an end result demoralises the student if the student is trapped in a cycle of poverty struggling to attain money or a goal.</p>
          
        <p>“Things going as planned” was another student’s view of success which can tend to lead a troublesome road especially for students who are placed in situations with unforeseen disruptions. A student who plans to simply go to school daily only for their plan to shift and change with obstacles in the way should not be seen as a failure as the plan shifts. The barriers during lockdown varied from a plan and displayed the social justice issues of the poverty cycle. Students such as Sione work hard to provide and look after their family but with extra help, they can be caught in the cycle. Providing temporary solutions such as afterschool tutorial sessions seemed to assist Sione throughout the project but it also provided them equitable opportunities to succeed.</p>
          
        <p>The critical analysis of the data and the Story of Sione paints a picture of students whose lives are filled with obstacles and unforeseen circumstances no matter how hard students are facing the difficulties of realities early especially with the introduction of Covid-19. Co-creating e-learning experiences with students provided opportunities for success. The opportunities for success through collaboration through student voice and e-learning provide value for students where time is of the essence and an extra hand is lended. Their ability to engage in the learning is evident through the determination of people assisting students to feel success through time and effort.</p>
          
        <p>The Story of Sione is a story to be shared among students, teachers, staff, families, and to anyone with an ear to lend. The story is shared online along with the report to enable readers and viewers to follow the journey through the various types of media including audio and video recordings. The students are the first to see the project in whole as without their time and thoughts, the project would be empty. The Story of Sione has impacted the way I teach as it allows me to teach differently from a traditional system.</p>          
          
        <p>There are more stories to be heard and more stories need to be told to be able to have a deeper understanding for frequently absent students and to end it here would be a disservice to those students.</p>
